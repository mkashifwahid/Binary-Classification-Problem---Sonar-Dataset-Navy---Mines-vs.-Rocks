# Binary-Classification-Problem-Sonar-Dataset-Navy-Mines-vs.-Rocks

In this project you will discover how to effectively use the Keras library in your machine learning project by working through a binary classification project step-by-step.

After completing this project, you will know:

•	How to load training data and make it available to Keras.
•	How to design and train a neural network for tabular data.
•	How to evaluate the performance of a neural network model in Keras on unseen data.
•	How to perform data preparation to improve skill when using neural networks.
•	How to tune the topology and configuration of neural networks in Keras.
